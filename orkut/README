                      Version 2.0
                      EXPERIMENTAL

Copyright (c) 2009 - 2011 Google Inc. -  All rights reserved.


WHAT'S NEW IN 2.0?
   Now the orkut Client Library is much easier to use. A large
   chunk of needed functionality was transferred from the samples
   to the actual library -- this means that you'll now be able
   to use the library "out of the box" without having to copy-paste
   pieces of code from the samples.

   A new class, OrkutAdapter, makes it much easier to interact with
   the library and perform common operations.

INTRODUCTION
   The orkut client library allows you to access and update orkut's social
   data. This library is experimental at present and may change in the
   future. We will try to maintain backward compatibility, but can't
   make any guarantees.

   Please make sure to read the Client Library Developer's Guide at:
   http://code.google.com/apis/orkut/docs/clientlib/intro.html

   You can download the latest version of this library from:
   http://code.google.com/p/orkut-os-client

   Usage of this library requires that you adhere to the orkut Developer
   Terms of Service. Please check them at:
   http://www.orkut.com/Main#DeveloperTerms.aspx

   Please also be mindful of the Branding Guidelines:
   http://www.orkut.com/html/en-US/branding.guidelines.html

   For bug reports, feature requests, etc, please get in touch with us
   through our developer forum at:
   http://code.google.com/apis/orkut/forum


GETTING OAUTH KEYS
   orkut replies on OAuth for authentication. In order to use this library
   at all (even for testing), you will need to have an OAuth consumer
   key and secret. Please visit this URL for instructions on how to
   register your domain to get these credentials.

   http://code.google.com/apis/accounts/docs/RegistrationForWebAppsAuto.html#new

   The consumer key is typically the site url, e.g. "my.site.com",
   while the secret is a sequence of randomly generated characters.


PACKAGES
   The library comes in two package formats. This README file is common
   to both formats, so it has information that pertains to both. The
   two possible formats are:

   BINARY ONLY PACKAGE (orkut-os-client-bin-(version).zip)
      This package only contains the library binaries in the form
      of a single JAR file that you can easily compile with. Just
      put it in your classpath and write code! This is the recommended
      package for beginners and for developers who don't intend to
      work with the library's source code.

   FULL SOURCE PACKAGE (orkut-os-client-full-(version).zip)
      This package contains the full source code and individual
      JARs that make up the dependencies, and also several
      of the past samples that are obsolete but can still provide
      good insight into how things work.


USING THE LIBRARY
   If you only intend to USE the library, not to modify it, you are
   better off with the BINARY ONLY PACKAGE. Please make sure your version
   is that one. In this case, using the library is a simple matter:
   just add orkut-os-client-(version).jar to your classpath to compile
   and run. Your favorite development environment should have an easy
   way to do that. If you are using the command line to compile, you
   can simply add the JAR file to your CLASSPATH environment variable,
   or feed it with the classpath parameters to the compiler and the
   interpreter. Either way, it should be very straightforward.
   
   You will need a compatible Java Development Kit. This library has 
   been built and runs on Java 1.5 (J2SE 5.0) and Java 1.6
   (JDK6). YMMV on different Java version.


SAMPLE
   The library comes with a sample that does a bit of everything.
   You can find it in the "sample" directory.


MODIFYING AND RECOMPILING THE LIBRARY
   Now this requires the FULL package (with source code). In this case,
   you will need the ant build system as well. The library's source
   code is located under the 'src' directory and there is a handy
   build.xml to compile it. Compiling it will generate the JAR.


DOCUMENTATION
   Please make sure to read the Client Library Developer's Guide at:
   http://code.google.com/apis/orkut/docs/clientlib/intro.html

   Also, if you are looking for reference material, the library
   comes with Javadoc documentation. In the BINARY package, this is
   located in the "doc" directory. In the FULL package, you will have
   to generate those yourself with the build.xml script and ant:
   simply type "ant javadoc".
   

KNOWN ISSUES
   1. Getting and setting activity comments is currently not possible.
   2. Fetching activity updates beyond the first page doesn't 
      yet work as expected and there may be a few updates missing 
      from the list compared to what is visible on the website.
   3. Internationalization of profile fields is not supported.
   4. For more known issues (and an update on these), please refer
      to the Orkut Developer Forum
      http://code.google.com/apis/orkut/forum.html

FAQ
   1. The following information from the user profile can be obtained:
   Name, Status, Emails, Gender, Phone Numbers, Birthday and Address.
   
   2. For a list of supported activity updates please refer to the class
   ActivityEntry.
   
   3. Limits on photo uploads are the same as that on the web frontend:
   you can upload photos upto 10MB in size. Each album can store 100
   photos, and there can be up to 10,000 photos in an account. The
   allowed file types are JPG, GIF and PNG.
   
   4. Captcha handling The API may occasionally throw Captchas to
   validate that it's indeed a human issuing the requests, for example,
   for the very frequent scrap posts. Captchas can be expected any time
   and, in general, every transaction should ideally be checked for a
   Captcha challenge.
   
   A brief overview of how to handle a captcha can be found here:
   http://code.google.com/apis/orkut/clientlib/errors.html
   
   A typical image URL returned from the challenge is
   /social/pages/captcha?xid=yyy. That must be prefixed with the endpoint
   URL (http://www.orkut.com), and then the Captcha image must be
   retrieved from the complete URL
   (http://www.orkut.com/social/pages/captcha?xid=yyy) using OAuth.
   The OrkutAdapter class will do that for you, though.
   
   5. If you wish to use this library commercially, you can do so without
   seeking our permission as long as you conform to
   
           a. the Developer Terms of Service
           (http://www.orkut.com/Main#DeveloperTerms.aspx), and 
   	
           b. the proper usage of the logo according to the branding
           guidelines
           (http://www.orkut.com/html/en-US/branding.guidelines.html). 
   
   But if you need to use the 'orkut' logo (instead of the 'Powered by
   orkut' logo) and/or you hit the quota limits as defined in the
   Developer ToS (see above). Please get in touch with us at
   orkutapirequests@google.com for a contract.
   
   Enjoy! 
   
   The orkut team
